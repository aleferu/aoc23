# Advent of Code 2023

My take on [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023 "AOC23") using Python.

## Where are the input files?

Apparently input files are supposed to be ignored by git. I use the network tab of my Chrome web browser to create a cURL command, that way I can download the input files for each day in a easy way.

## Organization

Each day (directory) will have two files:

- `part1.py`: solution to the part one problem of that day.
- `part2.py`: solution to the part two problem of that day.

## Requirements

* Python>=3.10
  * Reason: `match-case` statement used (in day1, for example).

Right now no additional packages are needed so I'm not creating a `requirements.txt` until it's neccesary.

## Will this repository be updated?

Yes! As soon as I can, though. I'm currently studying so my time is limited. Currently:

| Problem       | Status    |
| :-----------: | :-------: |
| Day01 - Part1 | Solved    |
| Day01 - Part2 | Solved    |
| Day02 - Part1 | Solved    |
| Day02 - Part2 | Solved    |
| Day03 - Part1 | Solved    |
| Day03 - Part2 | Unreached |
| Day04 - Part1 | Unreached |
| Day04 - Part2 | Unreached |
| Not out       | Not out   |

## Additional information

All suggestions are welcome!
