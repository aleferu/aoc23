# Advent of Code 2023

My take on [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023 "AOC23") using Python.


## Organization

Each day (directory) will have three files:

- `input.txt`: input of the problem.
  - This file will be separated into two files, `input1.txt` and `input2.txt` if problems don't share the same input (I don't know if this will ever be the case).
- `part1.py`: solution to the part one problem of that day.
- `part2.py`: solution to the part two problem of that day.

## Requirements

* Python>=3.10
  * Reason: `match-case` statement used (in day1, for example).

Right now no additional packages are needed so I'm not creating a `requirements.txt` until it's neccesary.

## Will this repository be updated?

Yes! As soon as I can, though. I'm currently studying so my time is limited.

## Additional information

All suggestions are welcome!
